Radiate was a two-day hackathon organized by Alpha Bio Cell on 9th-10 of May. Our goal was to try to break 
the monotony of everyday life of the imposed lockdown by hosting an ideathon and 
creating an online forum full of brilliant ideating minds who can work with each other’s 
expertise to create ideas to solve the problems of today. The participants will have to solve 
a set of riddles on an online platform that will lead to their ultimate problem statement.
This ideathon also aims to showcase the powerful tool that technology is, as it helps us bring 
everyone together in times of isolation.

## EVENT 1: Perplex
The aim of this round was to give our participants’ teams a chance to go on an intellectual 
journey through a series of riddles. These riddles will ignite the participants’ cognitive 
capacities, while at the same time gifting them parts of their problem statement. Hence 
these riddles have to be solved to get the ultimate problem statement.

## Event 2: Ignite
This round was all about ideation and not applying boundaries to thoughts. The teams are 
expected to come up with novel and creative, sustainable ideas pertaining to solving 
the problem in their respective problem statements.

## Event 3: Lumos
On the basis of their work, certain teams were selected from round 2, and these teams 
pitched their respective ideas over video conferencing to the panel on the 
basis of which they were evaluated and awarded.
